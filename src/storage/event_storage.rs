//! Event storage implementation for wallet events
//!
//! This module provides SQLite-based storage for wallet events, implementing
//! an append-only event log with proper indexing and querying capabilities.
//!
//! ## Feature Requirements
//!
//! This module requires the `storage` feature to be enabled:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! lightweight_wallet_libs = { version = "0.2", features = ["storage"] }
//! ```
//!
//! Without the `storage` feature, this module is not available and wallet
//! operations will use memory-only event storage.
