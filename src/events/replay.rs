//! Event replay engine for reconstructing wallet state from historical events
//!
//! This module provides functionality to replay wallet events in chronological order
//! to reconstruct wallet state. This is essential for state verification, debugging,
//! and recovering from data corruption.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - **Chronological replay**: Events are processed in the exact order they occurred
//! - **Incremental replay**: Resume replay from any sequence number
//! - **Batch processing**: Handle large event logs efficiently
//! - **Progress tracking**: Monitor replay progress with callbacks
//! - **Error handling**: Graceful handling of corrupted or missing events
//! - **Cancellation support**: Ability to cancel long-running replay operations
//! - **State verification**: Compare replayed state against current wallet state
//! - **Discrepancy detection**: Identify and report differences between states
